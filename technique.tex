% describe our novel approach; usually starts with an overview, a figure showing the overall process, 
% and then elaborate on each component of the process in a following subsection
\section{Technique and Evaluation}
The study will focus on the network and communication aspect of cloud computing. First, a comprehensive literature survey will be performed where a list of challanges will be curated. Then, proposed solutions to tackle the challenges will be assessed quantitavely and qualitatively. The results along with further investigation will used to identify future challanges and their possible solutions. Empirical method will be utilized to produce the results.

Recent advancement in computer technology especially the abundance of cheap storage, high-speed networks, and computing power has resulted in emergence of cloud computing where verious computing resources and services can be utilized via Internet. While cloud computing model has provided a myrad of benefits such as cost savings, flexibility, on demand service, pay-as-you-go, scalability, and reliability,  it poses several challanges. One of the challanges lies in the fact that the cloud resources are accessed remotely over the Internet. In this paper, we present a detailed survey of networking and communication related challanges in cloud computing. Several issues have been identified in the literature where some of the issues have been addressed and resolved while some still remain open. We will investigate into challanges such as performance, reliability, security, existing networking protocols etc. The overall goal of this survey paper is to provide a comprehensive study of the network and communication related challenges in latest advancement of cloud computing. The challenges addressed in the literatue will also be evaluated in terms of their success and limitations. Our study is expected to make a significant contribution as a reference resource in current  ongoing research efforts in cloud computing.

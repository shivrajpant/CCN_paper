\section{Expected results and Conclusion}
%\vspace{-2pt}

Despite being development of fast and secure networks, challanges remain to be addressed for cloud networks. Only a comprehensive study of the literature can help understand the problem and overcome such challanges. The results of this study aims at the very purpose providing a thorough evaluation of the key network and communication challanges experienced in cloud based solutions. This paper will to show criticality of the challanges which will be helpful in suggesting new solutions for future enhancement of network technology for clouds.  

%Summary of what the paper presented and what the paper means for science and practice. Main things to do next (what this work enables that wasn't possible before) -- can be a bit speculative and can include things we don't necessarily plan to do, but others might want to do to expand this work.
